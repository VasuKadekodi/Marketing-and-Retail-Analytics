# 🛍️📦📊💰 OList E-commerce Inventory Management 💰📊📦🛍️

## 🔎 Problem Statement:
E-commerce companies like OList need to manage their inventory effectively to reduce unnecessary costs. To do this, they must identify the top-performing products and analyze customer purchase behavior. The goal is to identify product categories that can be removed without significantly impacting business.

## 📊 Approach:
We will use the structured problem-solving approach of Pareto analysis, which asserts that 80% of outcomes result from 20% of all causes. We will also use market basket analysis to understand which product combinations are sold more than others. After identifying beneficial categories, we will explore ways to reduce the number of items in a particular category.

### 📈 Top Products and Categories:
We used Pareto analysis to identify the top-performing products and categories that contribute the most to the company's revenue. This information can help the team make informed decisions about which products to focus on and which categories to prioritize.

### 🛍️ Market Basket Analysis:
We conducted market basket analysis to understand customer purchase behavior and identify product combinations that are frequently purchased together. This information can be used to create bundles or discounts on products that are often purchased together, increasing sales and customer satisfaction.

### 📉 Reducing Category Items:
We explored ways to reduce the number of items in a particular category without significantly impacting business. We analyzed sales and inventory data to determine the ideal category depth and identified slow-moving products that can be removed from the category.

### 💡 Recommendations:
Based on our analysis, we recommend the following actions to OList:

1️⃣ Focus on top-performing products and categories to increase revenue.
2️⃣ Create bundles or discounts on frequently purchased products to increase sales and customer satisfaction.
3️⃣ Remove slow-moving products from categories to reduce costs and optimize inventory management.

Overall, our analysis provides valuable insights into OList's inventory management and can help the company make data-driven decisions to improve its business performance.
